├── Day-001-to-100/        ← Folders for each day
└── Resources/             ← Study materials
```

### Step 3: Start Day 1 (1 minute)
```bash
# Navigate to Day 1
cd Day-001

# View the problems for today
cat README.md
```

## 📋 Daily Workflow (20 minutes/day minimum)

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)
1. Open `TOPICS.md` to see today's problems
2. Navigate to today's day folder
3. Read problem statements

### Coding Session (2-3 hours)
1. **Solve Problems**
   - Start with easier problems
   - Write clean, commented code
   - Test with multiple test cases

2. **Create Solution Files**
   ```bash
   # Example for Day 1
   touch 01_reverse_array.cpp
   touch 02_find_max_min.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Template**
   - Include problem description
   - Add time/space complexity
   - Document your approach

### Evening Routine (15 minutes)
1. **Update Documentation**
   - Fill in day's README.md
   - Document learnings
   - Note difficulties faced

2. **Update Progress**
   - Mark completed problems in PROGRESS.md
   - Update statistics

3. **Commit Your Work**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Day 1: Completed reverse array and find max/min"
   git push origin main
   ```

## 🎯 First Week Plan

### Day 1-2: Get Comfortable
- ✅ Solve 2 easy array problems
- ✅ Set up your coding environment
- ✅ Get familiar with the workflow

### Day 3-5: Build Momentum
- ✅ Increase to 2-3 problems per day
- ✅ Start timing yourself
- ✅ Review Day 1-2 solutions

### Day 6-7: Establish Routine
- ✅ Maintain consistent schedule
- ✅ Document patterns you notice
- ✅ Plan for Week 2

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 🏆 Do's
- ✅ Start with problems marked in TOPICS.md
- ✅ Write code even if you look at hints
- ✅ Document your thought process
- ✅ Review previous solutions regularly
- ✅ Join a study group or find a partner
- ✅ Take breaks when stuck

### ❌ Don'ts
- ❌ Don't skip days (consistency is key!)
- ❌ Don't just copy solutions
- ❌ Don't ignore time/space complexity
- ❌ Don't avoid difficult problems forever
- ❌ Don't forget to update PROGRESS.md

- Identify inputs and outputs
- Note constraints
- Think of edge cases

### 2️⃣ Plan (10 minutes)
- Discuss brute force approach
- Think of optimizations
- Estimate time/space complexity
- Choose data structures

### 3️⃣ Code (30 minutes)
- Write clean code
- Add comments
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow language conventions

### 4️⃣ Test (10 minutes)
- Test with examples
- Check edge cases
- Verify complexity
- Debug if needed

### 5️⃣ Optimize (5 minutes)
- Can you do better?
- Different approach?
- Trade-offs?

## 🔥 Motivation Boosters
