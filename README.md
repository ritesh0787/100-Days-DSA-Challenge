# 🚀 100 Days of DSA Challenge

## 📌 Mission Statement

I am a Computer Science student in the UK, committed to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms through consistent daily practice. This repository documents my 100-day journey from January 2026 to April 2026, preparing for placements starting October 2026.

**Goal:** Solve 200+ problems across all major DSA topics and build strong problem-solving fundamentals for technical interviews.

## 🎯 Why This Challenge?

- **Placement Goal:** Secure a strong software engineering role by October 2026
- **Skill Building:** Transform from someone who knows DSA theory to someone who can solve problems efficiently
- **Consistency:** Build the discipline of daily practice, which is more valuable than sporadic intensity
- **Public Accountability:** Track progress transparently and stay motivated
